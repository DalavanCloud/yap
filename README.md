A C++14-and-later expression template library

This is a proposed Boost library.  It covers the same problem space as Boost.Proto, but works quite differently, due to the availability of lots of new features in C++14 and later.

The master branch contains a C++17 implementation.  The C++14 implementation is on a branch called "c++14".
